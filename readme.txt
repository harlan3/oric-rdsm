Oric RDSM - Orbis Software
--------------------------

Oric RDSM provides Java object persistence and introspection through the use of 
a Recursive Descent Symbol Map. The introspection capability is useful in a 
variety of tools, such as simple code generators that require information on the
fields of existing Java classes. This capability is also useful for tools that 
require an interface to provide the runtime inspection of POJOs.
